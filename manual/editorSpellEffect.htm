<li><span class="item">search</span><br>
This is the search button to use when there are many items in the list. It searches for effect names that contain the string written in the text field.
<li><span class="item">Effect name</span><br>
Enter the name of the spell effect set. This name is given by the scenario creator to identify each spell effect set and is not used during the game.
<li><span class="item">[Effect]</span><br>
Set the list of spell effects. The following spell effects can be used by adventurers (spells, item use effects, item SP) or monsters (spells), and each has an effective target. If the target is a single ally, you will need to select a target before the effect is activated, but if different target selections are set, such as one adventurer or one monster, you can only select the first target for the effect that requires it, and the rest will be selected randomly. <br>
When a monster uses a spell that targets an "enemy group," if the "Monster group spells target all PCs" box in the "Main" tab is checked, the spell will target everyone in the adventurer's party. If it is unchecked, the front and back rows of the party are considered separate groups, and the effect will be activated on either the front or back row. <br>
In addition to being used by adventurers and monsters, spell effects can also be used in events (treasure chest traps, events in dungeons), but the target is specified separately when using events, so the target specified here will be ignored. Also, if the effect of using a spell or item has multiple effects, you can only select the PC if the target is one ally in the selection formula during camping, but you cannot select the target for others, and it will be selected randomly (if the target is "all allies", "all enemies", or the caster himself", it will remain the same, but if the target is "one ally", "one enemy", or "enemy group", it will become "one ally (random)", "one enemy (random)", or "enemy group (random)").

When learning a spell with this spell effect, the increase in maximum MP is processed in the same way as when learning a spell at level up. However, current MP is not restored, so if you want to learn a spell that you have never memorized (a spell that consumes 1 MP or more) and be able to use it immediately, combine it with MP recovery.
<li><span class="item"><a name="21">21:Spell Forget</a></span><br>

If you check the top "Learnable spells only", the spell will only be forgotten if the checked spell family and specified spell level are the spell family and spell level that the adventurer to be forgotten can learn due to his/her job. If "Learnable spells only" is not checked, the spell will be forgotten regardless of whether it can be learned normally. There is no point in checking only "Learnable spells only". <br>
For the spell level, specify the level of the spell to be forgotten with a number from 0 to 9. 0 is for a 1st level spell, 6 is for a 7th level spell. Multiple levels can be specified, for example, 1st to 3rd level would be "012", 4th to 7th level would be "3456", 2nd and 6th level would be "15". <br>

Specify the spell to be forgotten with a number from 0 to 5. As with the spell level, multiple spells can be specified. <br>
For resistance, specify the percentage chance of resistance using a formula, and refer to the caster (user) as my, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending yourself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending yourself" as plus. If resisted, forgetting will not occur. If you do not want to be resisted, set resistance to 0. <li><span class="item"><a name="22">22: Add Item</a></span><br>

If you select "Unequipped only," equipped items (including cursed items) will not be erased, but if you select "Equipped as well," equipped items will be erased as long as they are not cursed, and if you select "Cursed as well," items will be erased whether they are equipped or cursed. <br>

<li><span class="item"><a name="24">24: Item transformation</a></span><br>
Can be used by adventurers and in events, and will transform a specified item held by the caster (user) into a different item. <br>

For example, if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 4, and a modifier of +3 is added, the result will be a modifier of 7, but if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 7, no modifier will be added. <br>
If [Round to upper and lower limits] is checked, the original modifier will be rounded to the upper and lower limits if the result of adding the modifier of this spell effect to the original modifier is outside the upper and lower limits.

For resistance, the percentage of chance of being resisted is specified by a formula, the caster (user) is my, the target is target, the target's spell resistance modifier is spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself is parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" is plus.

<li><span class="item"><a name="59">59: Breath Resistance Modifier (During Combat)</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters during combat, and applies a modifier to the breath resistance rate of the caster (user), allies, and enemies that is only effective during combat. Only living beings (those who are not dead, turned to ashes, or annihilated) are affected. This modifier effect is calculated by adding it to non-combat-limited modifiers, and can be stacked any number of times, but will be nullified when the battle ends. Unlike non-combat-limited modifiers, if all allies are targeted, this effect will be applied to each individual as normal. <br>
Upper and lower limits are specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my, and the target with target. Use this if you want to set a limit when stacking. Leave this field blank if you do not want to set a limit. <br>
If [Round at upper and lower limits] is not checked, the modifier will be applied if the original modifier is within the upper and lower limits, and will not be applied if it is outside the upper and lower limits. As a result, the upper and lower limits may be exceeded. For example, if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 4, and a modifier of +3 is added, the result will be a modifier of 7, but if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 7, no modifier will be applied. <br>
If [Round to upper and lower limits] is checked, the value will be rounded to the upper and lower limits if the result of adding the modifier of this spell effect to the original modifier is outside the upper and lower limits. For example, if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 2, and a modifier of +2 is added, the result will be a modifier of 4, but if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 2, and a modifier of +4 is added, the result will be a modifier of 5. <br>
The number of turns of duration is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my and the target by target. If it is 0, it is only effective for that turn, if it is 1 or more, it will be the number of turns of duration from the next turn onwards, and if it is -1, it will be permanent (until the target dies, the battle ends, the effect is erased, etc.). However, if a new effect is applied, the number of turns of duration will be overwritten, so if the effect is designed to be applied in a stacking manner, it is not very meaningful. <br>
The modifier is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my and the target by target. The modifier specified here is the breath resistance modifier that can be referenced with spellPlus and plus in the breath resistance rate in the "Combat" tab. <br>
For resistance, the percentage of chance of being resisted is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) is my, the target is target, the target's spell resistance modifier is spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself is parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" can be referenced with plus. If resisted, the modifier is not applied. If you do not want to be resisted, set resistance to 0.
<li><span class="item"><a name="60">60: Spell Seal</a></span><br>
Can be used by adventurers, monsters, and events, and targets adventurers (ally when used by adventurers, enemy when used by monsters), making them unable to use spells (status abnormality "seal"). It only has an effect on living beings (those who are not dead, turned to ashes, or vanished). <br>
If the duration is between 1 and 1000, it will be effective for the specified number of steps, if it is 1001, it will be effective until you move to a new floor, if it is 1002, it will be effective until you leave the dungeon, but it will be invalidated if you enter the Dark Zone. If the duration is negative (the absolute value is treated the same as when it is positive), it will not be invalidated even if you enter the Dark Zone. <br>
For resistance, the percentage probability of resistance is specified using a formula, and the caster (user) is specified as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending yourself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending yourself" as plus can be referenced. If resisted, the spell will not be sealed. If you do not want to be resisted, set resistance to 0. <li><span class="item"><a name="61">61: Continuous HP Recovery</a></span><br>
Can be used by adventurers, monsters, and events, and applies a modification to the HP recovery per turn to the adventurer (ally if used by an adventurer, enemy if used by a monster). If the target is an individual, it only has an effect on living people (those who are not dead, turned to ashes, or vanished). <br>
If the duration is between 1 and 1000, it will be effective for the specified number of steps, if it is 1001, it will be effective until you move to a new floor, if it is 1002, it will be effective until you leave the dungeon, but it will be invalidated if you enter the Dark Zone. If the duration is negative (the absolute value is treated the same as when it is positive), it will not be invalidated even if you enter the Dark Zone. <br>
The modification value is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my. If the target is an individual rather than a party, the target can be referenced with target. <br>
Resistance is only available when an individual is the target. The percentage of chance of resistance is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) is my, the target is target, the target's spell resistance modifier is spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself is parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" is plus. If resisted, the modifier is not applied. If you do not want to be resisted, set resistance to 0. <br>
This effect can be cast separately on the party and each adventurer (if it is cast on all allies, the effect is applied to the party as a whole, not each adventurer), and the effects of each are added together, but if cast again on the same target, the effects will be overwritten. <br>

Can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and applies a modifier to the HP recovery per turn that is only effective during battle, targeting the caster (user), allies, and enemies. Only those who are alive (not dead, turned to ashes, or vanished) are affected. This modifier effect is calculated by adding it to the non-battle-limited modifier, and can be stacked any number of times, but will be nullified at the end of battle. Unlike the non-battle-limited modifier, if this is targeted at all allies, the effect will be applied to each individual as usual. <br>
The upper and lower limits are specified by a formula for the upper and lower limits of the modifier value, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my and the target with target. Use this if you want to set a limit when stacking. Leave this field blank if you do not want to set any particular limit. <br>
If [Round to limits] is not checked, the modifier will be applied if the original modifier is within the limits, and will not be applied if it is outside the limits. As a result, the limits may be exceeded. For example, if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 4, and a modifier of +3 is added, the result will be a modifier of 7, but if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 7, no modifier will be applied. <br>
If [Round to limits] is checked, the value will be rounded to the upper or lower limit if the result of adding the modifier of this spell effect to the original modifier is outside the upper or lower limits. For example, if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 2, and a modifier of +2 is added, the result will be a modifier of 4, but if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 2, and a modifier of +4 is added, the result will be a modifier of 5. <br>
The number of turns of duration is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my and the target by target. If it is 0, it is only effective for that turn, if it is 1 or more, it will be effective for the next turn onwards, and if it is -1, it will be permanent (until the target dies, combat ends, or the effect is removed, etc.). However, if it is newly stacked, the number of turns will be overwritten, so if it is designed to be stacked, it is not very useful. <br>
The modifier is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my, and the target with target. <br>
The percentage probability of resistance is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my, the target with target, and the target's spell resistance modifier with spellPlus, the modifier if you are defending yourself with parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier if you are defending yourself" with plus. If resisted, the modifier is not applied. If you do not want to be resisted, set resistance to 0. <li><span class="item"><a name="63">63: Breath Barrier</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and casts a barrier that nullifies breaths on the caster (user), allies, and enemies. Once nullified, the barrier disappears, but the barrier can be stacked up to 99,999 times. <br>
The upper and lower limits are specified by a formula for the upper and lower limits of the modifier, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my and the target with target. Use this if you want to set a limit when stacking. Leave this field blank if you do not want to set a limit. <br>
If [Round at upper and lower limits] is not checked, the original modifier will be modified if it is within the upper and lower limits, and will not be modified if it is outside the upper and lower limits. As a result, the upper and lower limits may be exceeded. For example, if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 4, and a modifier of +3 is added, the result will be a modifier of 7, but if the upper limit is 5 and the original modifier is 7, no modifier will be added. <br>
If [Round to upper and lower limits] is checked, the value will be rounded to the upper and lower limits if the original modifier plus the modifier of this spell effect is outside the upper and lower limits. For example, if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 2, and a modifier of +2 is added, the result will be a modifier of 4, but if the upper limit is 5, the original modifier is 2, and a modifier of +4 is added, the result will be a modifier of 5. <br>

This effect can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and applies a correction to the order of actions of the caster (user) on the turn it is used. <br>

This effect is special, as it works when determining the order of actions at the start of a turn, not when the spell is cast during battle. If there are multiple of this effect in a spell effect, only the first one is effective. Also, even if there are conditional branching or mutations based on gender or personality (when the activation type is selectable or random and multiple spell effects are included), if even one of them contains this effect, it will work regardless of the conditions. <br>
The correction value is specified in the formula as the correction value for the action order determination value (simply added), and the caster (user) can be referenced with my. For example, if you want to have them act first in the turn, depending on the size of the original action order determination value, specify a large positive value such as 100. Conversely, if you want them to act last in the turn, specify a large negative value with an absolute value such as -100.

The damage attribute can be selected from Fire, Cold, Electricity, Holy, Unattributed, or None. <br>
The damage value is specified using a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my and the target with target. By setting the damage value to negative, the damage can also be recovered. <br>
As a special specification of damage value, by specifying attackDamageMain and attackDamageSub, you can refer to the damage value when performing a normal attack with the main weapon and subweapon, respectively (if there is no subweapon equipped, the value of attackDamageSub is 0). Weapon range, number of attack targets (group attack), attack additional effects, etc. are ignored. In the case of monsters, attackDamageSub can refer to the second attack damage value when two attacks are possible (0 if there are no two attacks). <br>
For resistance, the percentage probability of resistance is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) is specified as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" can be referenced as plus. If resisted, the damage is halved (rounded up). <br>
This only has meaning when targeting monsters, but you can determine the type of monster that is effective with the checkbox. This can be used to create attack spells that deal large damage only to undead monsters. <br>
When a monster uses this spell effect on an adventurer, you can choose the state of the adventurer when they die from "Death", "Ashes", or "Disappearance".
<li><span class="item"><a name="201">201: Reduce Life, Instant Death, HP Absorption</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and will target the enemy with one of the following effects: Reduce Life, Instant Death, or HP Absorption. Reduce Life reduces the target's HP to single digits. Instant Death kills the target instantly. HP Absorption reduces the target's HP to single digits, and the difference is added to your own HP. Reduce Life and HP Absorption have no effect if the target's HP is already in single digits. <br>
For resistance, you can specify the percentage of chance of being resisted using a formula, refer to the caster (user) as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending yourself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending yourself" as plus. These three effects have no effect if resisted. Also, normally instant death effects do not apply to targets with instant death resistance, but if resistance is set to a negative value, the resistance ability will be ignored and resistance will be judged. In that case, resistance from -100 to -200 will be treated as 0 to 100 during the judgment. <br>
This only has meaning when targeting monsters, but you can use the checkbox to determine the type of monster that is effective. I think it can be used to create spells that instantly kill only undead monsters. <br>
If you set the death text, you can change the message that appears when the target dies from an instant death effect. The target's name can be referenced with [target]. <br>
When a monster uses this spell effect on an adventurer, you can choose from "Death", "Ashes", or "Disappearance" for the state the adventurer will be in when they die.
<li><span class="item"><a name="202">202: Breath</a></span><br>
This can only be used by adventurers and monsters in battle, and it will breathe a breath on the enemy. <br>
The breath attribute can be chosen from Fire, Cold, Electricity, Holy, or No Attribute. <br>

The strength is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my, and the target by target. <br>
Think of sleep strength as sleep depth (sleep value). When asleep, the value decreases as turns pass and as you are attacked, and when it falls below 0, you will wake up. Sleep depth is added each time you receive a sleep effect. If the sleep depth becomes negative due to a spell effect, you will faint instead of sleep, and in that case you will not recover naturally. <br>
Silence strength is almost the same as sleep strength, and if it is a positive value, the value decreases each turn, and when it falls below 0, the silence will be lifted. If silence strength is set to negative, it will be a silence effect that does not recover naturally. <br>
The absolute value of the specified value is the suppression strength, and it will recover naturally as turns pass. <br>
For resistance, the percentage of chance of being resisted is specified by a formula, the caster (user) is my, the target is target, the target's spell resistance modifier is spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself is parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" is plus. These three effects have no effect if resisted. Also, normally sleep and silence effects are not applied to targets with sleep and silence resistance, but if resistance is set to a negative value, resistance ability is ignored and resistance checks are made. In that case, resistance from -100 to -200 is treated as 0 to 100 when making the check.
<li><span class="item"><a name="204">204: MP Damage</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and deals MP damage to enemies. <br>
The damage value is specified by a formula, the caster (user) is my, and the target is target. When MP is damaged, MP is reduced by the damage value, randomly selected from each level of each spell school. <br>
For resistance, the percentage probability of resistance is specified using a formula, and the caster (user) is referred to as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" as plus can be referenced. If resisted, the damage is halved (rounded up). If you do not want resistance, set resistance to 0.
<li><span class="item"><a name="205">205: Remove spell immunity</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters in battle, and reduces the spell immunity rate of the enemy to 0. This effect reduces both the target's original spell immunity rate and the spell immunity rate modifier from spells, etc., to 0. <br>
For resistance, the percentage probability of resistance is specified using a formula, and the caster (user) is referred to as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" as plus can be referenced. If resisted, the effect will not be applied at all. If you do not want to be resisted, set resistance to 0.
<li><span class="item"><a name="206">206: Poison</a></span><br>
Can be used by adventurers, monsters, and events, and inflicts poison effects on the caster (user), allies, and enemies (changes poison damage). <br>
The change value is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my, and the target by target. <br>
For resistance, the percentage of chance of being resisted can be specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my, the target by target, the target's spell resistance modifier by spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself by parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" by plus. If resisted, the effect is not applied at all. Also, normally poison does not affect targets with poison resistance, but if resistance is set to a negative value, the resistance ability will be ignored when making a resistance check. In that case, resistance from -100 to -200 will be treated as 0 to 100 when checking.
<li><span class="item"><a name="207">207: Continuous HP Damage</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and inflicts damage to the caster (user), allies, and enemies every turn. <br>
The number of turns that lasts is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my, and the target by target. If it is 0, the damage is dealt at the end of the turn the spell was cast and the effect disappears. If it is 1, it lasts until the next turn. There is no particular limit to the number of turns that lasts, and it can be 100 or 1000, but if you set it to -1, it will be permanent (until the target dies, the battle ends, or the effect is erased), so make use of it. <br>
The damage attribute can be selected from fire, cold, electricity, holy, non-elemental, and none. <br>
The damage value is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my, and the target by target. If the damage value is negative, it is treated as a recovery effect. In the case of a recovery effect, processing such as halving due to attributes is not applied, but value reduction due to resistance checks is applied. Valid values ​​range from -9999 to 9999. <br>
For resistance, the percentage probability of being resisted is specified in the formula, and the caster (user) is referred to as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" as plus can be referenced. If resisted, the damage is halved. <br>
This only has meaning when targeting monsters, but you can use the checkbox to determine the type of monster that is effective. I think it can be used to create attack spells that deal large damage only to undead monsters. <br>
Damage and resistance calculations are performed when the effect is actually exerted (at the end of each turn), but if the caster's data is referenced, the value at the time the spell is cast is referenced. The target's data is calculated by referring to the value at the time the effect is exerted. <br>
When this spell effect is cast on the same target, it will stack without being overwritten. For example, if a target that originally has a +10 recovery effect is inflicted with 20 HP damage and -5 HP damage (recovery effect), the target will receive 5 damage per turn (if there is no attribute resistance and the resistance check is 0).
<li><span class="item"><a name="208">208: Erase HP Damage</a></span><br>
This can only be used by adventurers and monsters during battle, and erases HP damage effects from the caster (user), allies, and enemies. <br>
The number of effects to be erased is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced with my and the target with target. <br>
For resistance, the percentage of chance of being resisted is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) is referred to as my, the target as target, the target's spell resistance modifier as spellPlus, the modifier when defending oneself as parryPlus, and "spell resistance modifier + modifier when defending oneself" as plus can be referenced. If resisted, it will not be erased. If you do not want it to be resisted, set resistance to 0. <br>
Since continuous HP damage can be stacked with multiple effects with different damage values, attributes, resistance judgments, and durations, the number of continuous HP damage effects to be erased can be specified. When erasing, the most recent effects are erased first. The number of stackable effects is limited to 100, so there is no point in setting the number to erase to a number greater than that. Setting the number to erase to -1 will erase all effects at once. <li><span class="item"><a name="209">209: Paralysis, Petrification</a></span><br>
Can only be used by adventurers and monsters in battle, and will inflict either paralysis or petrification on enemies. <br>

If the attack cannot reach the enemy due to the attack range, the attack will be made to an enemy that can be reached. Also, if the hatred state is applied to a PC, the PC is the target, but if the hatred state is applied to a monster/summoned monster, the monster/summoned monster group is the target. <br>
The hatred state will be restored after the turn specified below has passed, the hated enemy dies, the hated enemy group is wiped out, a status recovery spell is applied, or the battle ends. <br>
The number of turns that the effect lasts is specified by a formula, and the caster (user) can be referenced by my, and the target by target. If it is 0, it is effective only for that turn, if it is 1 or more, it will be the number of turns that the effect lasts from the next turn onwards, and if it is set to -1, it will be permanent (until the target dies, the hated enemy dies, the battle ends, the status is restored, etc.).

<li><b>While Combat</b><br>
Messages that are set higher on the list than other effects will be displayed (first) before the results of other effects are displayed. Messages that are set below some effect will be displayed (last) after the results of other effects are displayed. <br>
For example, if the list of spell effect sets is as follows:
<ul class="text">
<li>Message Display A
<li>Message Display B
<li>Spell Effect α
<li>Message Display C
<li>Message Display D

Can be used by adventurers, monsters, and events, and sets the label used by "430: Spell Effect Skip". Set any name you want as the label so that it is easy to understand. You can also set a blank label. This effect alone does nothing in particular.
<li><span class="item"><a name="430">430: Spell Effect Skip</a></span><br>
Can be used by adventurers, monsters, and events, and skips the spell effect if the conditional expression is true. This is a simple conditional branch for spell effects. The selection of the effect target (internal processing) is performed normally regardless of whether or not there is a skip, so there is not much freedom in that area. <br>
In the conditional expression, when used by adventurers and monsters, the caster (user) can be referenced as my (also see target), and when used in events, the target can be referenced as target (also see my). If the condition is true, the skip is executed, if it is false, nothing will happen and the next process will proceed. <br>
The skip count specifies the number of spell effects to skip. If the skip count is 0, it will skip to the label. If it is set to the maximum value (999), all spell effects will be skipped. <br>
For spell effect labels, if the skip count is 0, it will skip up to the label with the same name. It will skip to the first label that matches the label set below the effect in the spell effect list, and will not skip upwards. A blank label is also allowed. <br>
Here is an example.
<ul class="text">
<li>Spell effect skip α (skip 1 if true)
<li>Spell effect A
<li>Spell effect B
<li>Spell effect skip β (skip to label "Process 3" if true)
<li>Spell effect C
<li>Spell effect skip γ (skip 999 if true)
<li>Spell effect label "Process 3"
<li>Spell effect D
</ul>
If the spell effect list is as above, first skip α is checked, and if it is false, effects A and B are executed. If α is true, one is skipped (effect A is skipped) and effect B is executed. <br>
Next, if skip β is checked and it is false, effect C is executed, and skip γ is forced to skip all, and the process is terminated. If β is true, it skips to label "Process 3", executes effect D, and ends.
</ul>
</ul>
