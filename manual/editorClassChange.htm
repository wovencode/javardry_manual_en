<ul class="text">
<li><span class="item">Enable Class Change</span><br>
   Checking this box allows class changes at the training grounds.
<li><span class="item">Additional Age</span><br>
   Specifies the additional age during a class change at the training grounds using a formula. The data of the character undergoing the change (prior to the class change) can be referenced with `pc`. For example, if the age increases by 2–5 years, use `1D4 + 1`. If there is no age addition, use `0`.
<li><span class="item">Level</span><br>
   Specifies the level after class change at the training grounds using a formula. The data of the character undergoing the change (prior to the class change) can be referenced with `pc`. To reset to the minimum level, use `1`. To maintain the level, use `pc.lv`.
<li><span class="item">HP</span><br>
   Specifies the HP (maximum HP) after class change at the training grounds using a formula. The data of the character undergoing the change (prior to the class change) can be referenced with `pc`. To maintain the HP, use `pc.hpMax0`. Leaving it blank will recalculate the HP based on the stats of the post-class-change job, but since the calculation occurs only once, it may result in extremely low values depending on the job’s HP formula.
<li><span class="item">Attributes</span><br>
   Specifies the attributes after class change at the training grounds for each attribute using a formula. The data of the character undergoing the change (prior to the class change) can be referenced with `pc`. To maintain the attributes, use `pc.abi0[ corresponding attribute number ]`. Leaving it blank will reset to the racial base value (+gender adjustment value).
