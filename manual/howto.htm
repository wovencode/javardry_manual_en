<h3 class="title1">How to play the game</h3>
<p class="text">
This article is for those who are new to Wizardry Like or unfamiliar with it, and will explain how to play the early stages of "Scenario #1: The Swordmaster King's Trial".
</p>

<h4>Title Screen</h4>
<p class="text">
In the title screen, you can choose whether to display a map (auto-mapping) or only the coordinate values ​​when using a spell to display your current location. The default is map display, which is fine for most situations. Only those who are passionate about hand mapping should choose the numerical display. <br>
Although graph paper is the best way to map, if you want to map on a PC, free software such as "D-Mapping2" or "Graph Paper Mapping" (both Windows only) are useful.

<h4>Registering Adventurers</h4>
<p class="text">
You can use the adventurers provided from the beginning, but here we will explain how to register (create) an adventurer. <br>
Adventurer registration is done at the training ground on the outskirts of town. A party is made up of six people, three in the front line and three in the rear line. The basic combination of jobs is three warriors in the front line, one wizard, one priest, and one thief in the rear line. One or two of the front line warriors can be high-class warriors such as samurai or lord, but be careful as they grow slowly. Also, if you add a bishop or increase the number of wizards or priests, make sure to put a priest or a thief in the front line. <br>
When registering, you will first enter a name, but you can change it later, so you can use any name you like. <br>
You can choose your race as you like, but each race has different initial and maximum characteristic values, and some jobs are more suitable than others. For example, a dwarf is good for a warrior, an elf for a wizard, a gnome for a priest, and a hobbit for a thief. However, I think it would be interesting to create a hobbit wizard with an emphasis on speed, and the previous example is not necessarily the best, so when choosing a race, it is a good idea to think about the type of adventurer you want to create. If you are unsure, it may be a good idea to choose a human or gnome with average trait values. <br>
Your personality will be decided according to the conditions of your job. However, good and evil adventurers cannot form parties, so you will have to choose between good and neutral, or neutral and evil. Also, if you plan to change jobs later, you will need to decide your personality based on that. However, the only job that only evil adventurers can change to is the ninja, so I recommend choosing between good and neutral at first. <br>
Your trait values ​​will be distributed as bonus points, but the bonuses are redistributed every time you press the Escape key, so you can distribute them until you get a value you are satisfied with. However, although you can get a bonus up to 60, the basic bonus is 5 to 9, and it is rare to get a value of 10 or 20 or more, so you should be satisfied with 15 to 19. If it's too much trouble, 8 or 9 will be fine. As for how to distribute the bonus, first distribute it according to the conditions of the job you want to take. The remaining bonuses are allocated mainly to agility, which affects the order of actions in battle, and to characteristic values ​​that are important to the class. For warriors, it is strength, for wizards, it is wisdom, for priests, it is faith, for thieves, it is luck, and so on. <br>
After allocating the bonuses, all that remains is to select a class and the adventurer registration is complete.

<h4>Preparing for Adventure</h4>
<p class="text">
Once you have gathered all your adventurers, you will form a party at a bar in the castle town. The first three will be the front line and the rest will be the rear line, so be careful about the order. Also, good and evil adventurers cannot form parties at bars. <br>
Once you have formed a party, the next step is to get equipment at a store. Front line warriors (warriors, samurai, lords, ninjas) should buy "long swords, breastplates, shields, helmets," priests should buy "flails, breastplates, shields," and thieves should buy "daggers, leather armor, small shields." If you don't have enough money, collect money from within your party and go shopping. If you still don't have enough, lower the rank of your equipment. It is safer to equip the first rear guard, i.e. the fourth member of the party, in case the front line falls, but if you don't have the time, you can leave it for later. Wizards and bishops don't need equipment because they can't be very active in the front line. If you're worried, get some when you have the money. Also, don't forget to equip the equipment you've purchased. <br>
If you still have money left after getting all the equipment, buy some healing potions and poison antidotes. You'll want to always have some poison antidotes, especially until your priest learns "antidote."

<h4>To the Underground Labyrinth</h4>
<p class="text">
When you're ready, enter the dungeon (underground labyrinth) from the outskirts of town. Immediately after entering the dungeon, the camp screen will appear, so if you forgot to bring any equipment, you can do so here. <br>
You start on the first basement floor, and your new party is so weak that they will be wiped out easily even on this floor, so it's best to make sure everyone is prepared.Until you reach bells 3-4, you will fight in the area near the entrance to raise your level. In this game, monsters are almost certain to be waiting in a specific room (or space) called the burial chamber, but the probability of encountering monsters wandering around in other places is set to be quite low. Therefore, you will first fight in several rooms near the entrance, and then defeat all the enemies in the burial chamber of that area, or immediately return to the surface when your party becomes exhausted. <br>
In "Scenario #1: The Swordmaster King's Trial", the map and current location will be displayed by using the map display key (default M, C on the keyboard, + on the numeric keypad, button 3 on the gamepad), so please make use of it. If you use the Mage spell "Clarity", the direction will also be displayed, and you can also see the map of floors other than the current floor that you have been to.
</p>

<h4>Early Game Tactics</h4>
<p class="text">
In the early game, the basic idea is to put the enemy to sleep. Some enemies do not sleep, but the Mage spell "Sleeping Cloud" and the Priest spell "Sleep Induction" are surprisingly useful until around the middle of the game, so make full use of them. Sleeping enemies cannot act, so attacks are easier to hit and damage is increased. <br>
When multiple groups of monsters start to appear, do not attack from the front group, but defeat monsters that use spells (spell users) or breathe monsters first. If you cannot get rid of them in one turn, put them to sleep with "Sleeping Cloud" or "Sleep Induction", or silence them with "Silence" if they are spell users. If you cannot beat them, it is best to run away quickly. <br>
When facing monsters you have never seen before, do not hold back and give it your all. It is common in Wizardry Like to be wiped out if you skimp on spells and items. It is also common to be wiped out if you think you can still go, so it is best to turn back while you still have the strength. <br>
As you level up, always cast spells such as "identify" and "sacred armor".

<h4>Handling treasure chests</h4>
<p class="text">
After the battle in the main chamber, you will be able to find the treasure chest in most cases. There are few items in the first basement floor, and even if there are, they are not very important. Also, you will often fail to identify and disarm traps when your level and attributes are low. However, there are no dangerous traps in the first basement floor that will kill you in one hit, so try identifying and disarming the traps as practice and opening them. If you have prepared some poison antidotes, are in a position where you can return to the surface quickly, and have enough HP, there is no need to be too afraid. However, there are many fatal traps on deeper floors, so it is important to use the thief's trap identification in combination with the Mage spell "see through", and depending on the trap identification results and the party's situation, it is also important to choose to give up. <br>
Items obtained from treasure chests are in an uncertain state, and although there is no difference in the effect when equipped or used, if they are left as is, they will be sold at a low price when sold to a store. To confirm an item, you can either pay the appraisal fee at a store to have it appraised, or have the adventurer's bishop appraise it. In the early stages when you don't have money, the appraisal fee to pay to the store is not insignificant, so it is often used to have the bishop in your party appraise it, or if there is no bishop in your party, have the bishop wait at the tavern and have him appraise it only. However, be careful because the success rate of appraisal is low for bishops with low levels and characteristics.
</p>

<h4>Recovery and level up</h4>
<p class="text">
Adventurers who are exhausted in the labyrinth can recover by resting at the adventurer's inn. To recover HP, you need to stay in a room with a simple bed or higher. Although it takes time, you can also stay in a stable to recover only MP, and then enter the labyrinth once and recover HP with a recovery spell. Using a stable is a standard method in Wizardry Like, and it is essential, especially in the early stages when you have little money. <br>
If you have enough experience, you will level up when you stay at an inn, and there will be changes such as learning spells, changing attribute values, and increasing HP.

</p>

<h4>Death and Resurrection of Adventurers</h4>
<p class="text">

If an adventurer dies (or is paralyzed or petrified), their body will be taken back to the surface and housed in a temple, where they can be resurrected. Since they are treated as being housed in a temple, when you go to the temple, do not include the adventurer you want to resurrect in your party, but form a party with adventurers who are able to act (not paralyzed, petrified, dead, or ashen). If you can use a resurrection spell, you can use the spell in the dungeon before returning to the surface, or if you have returned to the surface, you can add the target adventurer to your party at the tavern (take out the corpse) and use the spell in the dungeon to resurrect them. <br>
Even in temples, when adventurers use the Priest spells "Resurrection" and "Restore Soul", attempts to revive from death can fail. If an attempt to revive from death fails, the adventurer's body will turn to ash. You can try to revive from the ash, but if you fail again, the adventurer will disappear (become lost) and will never be able to revive again. <br>
If the party is wiped out in the dungeon, the adventurers' bodies will be left there (※ Depending on the scenario settings, they may be returned to the surface). You can collect the body by forming a party with other adventurers and using the "Find Allies" command in the submenu near the body. If you can't find where the body is, use the Priest spell "Search for Soul". Since a party can only have a maximum of six people, in order to collect the body, you must either make room in the retrieval party beforehand, or make room by using the "Remove from Allies" command in the submenu (split the party).
</p>

<h4>Suspending and resuming the game</h4>
<p class="text">
The game data is automatically saved at various times during the game. When you resume the game, if your party is on the ground, re-organize your party at the castle town bar. If your party is in the labyrinth, select "Resume adventure" on the outskirts of town.

<h4>How to proceed after that</h4>
<p class="text">
When you have reached a certain level, explore the first basement floor. Once you have explored it (you will go to some areas later), go down to the next floor and try fighting the enemies. If you can fight without any problems, start exploring, and if you feel that your level is not enough, you can level up in a place you can easily return to, or return to the first basement floor and level up. After that, you basically repeat this process. Just keep exploring, trying to fill up the map, and you will eventually be able to achieve your goal.
