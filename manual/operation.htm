<h4><a name="controlKey">Control keys, buttons</a></h4>
<p class="text">
The default settings are as follows, but you can change the settings of the keyboard keys and gamepad buttons in the <a href="#keyConfig">Key Settings</a>.

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li><span class="item">Up, Down, Left, Right Keys</span><br>

By default, these are set to the arrow keys on the keyboard, 2, 4, 6, and 8 on the numeric keypad, and the directional buttons on the gamepad.
<li><span class="item"><a name="shiftMoveKey">Left and Right Movement Keys</a></span><br>
Move left and right without changing direction when moving through the dungeon. This is known as crab walking. It also switches the display on the status screen, and switches the target when transferring items. It is intended to be assigned to the left and right buttons on a gamepad. <br>

<li><span class="item">Confirmation key</span><br>

<li><span class="item">Status Display Switch Key</span><br>
Toggles the display of the status window when moving through dungeons, and displays spell effects and other status when selecting commands during battle (depending on the scenario settings). <br>
By default, this is set to S on the keyboard, 3 on the numeric pad, and button 6 on the gamepad.
<li><span class="item">Submenu Display Key</span><br>

By default, this is set to A on the keyboard, 1 on the numeric pad, and button 2 on the gamepad.
<li><span class="item">Map Display Key</span><br>

Returns to the title screen. <br>
By default, this is set to R on the keyboard.
<li><span class="item">Debug Key</span><br>

</ul>

<h4><a name="gamepadOperation">Gamepad Operation</a></h4>

<p class="text">

You can operate with a gamepad by turning on gamepad operation in the arguments at run time or in Options during execution. However, since pressing multiple buttons at the same time is not supported, you cannot move left and right with Shift + left and right keys (you can move left and right with one button). The button identification name differs depending on the gamepad and execution environment, so check the identification name with <a href="start.htm#keyTest">Key test</a> in Options and perform <a href="#keyConfig">key configuration</a>. <br>
In the case of a Linux environment, you need to make the directory containing the native libraries (libjinput-linux.so, libjinput-linux64.so) recognized as a shared library through the path, and also change the permissions of /dev/input/* so that it can be read by anyone other than the owner. <br>
If you want to use a gamepad without relying on Javardry's functions, please use free software such as JoyToKey (Windows) or QJoyPad (Linux) that converts input from a gamepad to keyboard input.
</p>

<h4><a name="mouseOperation">Mouse operation</a></h4>
<p class="text">
If you turn on mouse operation in the arguments at run time or in the Options during execution, you will be able to operate by clicking on the screen. <br>
By left-clicking the range shown below, the corresponding key will be operated. Right-clicking is the cancel key operation. <br>
When using touch operation, the action of pressing and releasing after a long press may be the right-click operation, so pressing and holding a button for multiple hits is not supported. Instead, by clicking HoldDown, you can hold down the key you just pressed. Pressing (clicking) any key next will release the hold. <br>
<br>

</p>
<h4><a name="keyConfig">Key Settings</a></h4>
<p class="text">
You can set the keyboard keys and gamepad buttons for operation in keyConfig.txt in the data directory. This will not be reflected during startup, so if you change keyConfig.txt, restart Javardry.
