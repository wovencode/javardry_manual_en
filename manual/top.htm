<h3 class="title1">Introduction</h3>
<p class="text">
　Javardry is a Java-based clone of Wizardry. By replacing the scenario data created with JavardryEditor, you can play different scenarios. While it incorporates some unique features, think of it as a tool for creating and playing scenarios similar to Wizardry #1–#3 and Gaiden #1–#3.<br>
　Since the specifications of Javardry vary by scenario, this manual provides only general explanations. For gameplay, please refer to the manual of each scenario. For "Scenario #1: The Trial Grounds of the Swordsmith King," there is a <a href="howto.htm">guide for beginners or those unfamiliar with Wizardry-like games</a>. It is recommended to read it.<br>
　Although the JavardryEditor is called an editor, it is essentially a rudimentary input-support tool. Scenario data is plain text (.txt), which can be edited directly. However, doing so may disrupt formatting and make it unreadable, so it is generally safer to avoid direct editing. For tasks such as bulk renaming, direct editing can be convenient, but make sure to back up the data beforehand. I intend to fix obvious bugs, but any inconveniences are considered part of the design, so please bear with them. While this manual aims to explain the editor in detail, any unclear points can be addressed on the forum.<br>
　Frequently asked questions (or potentially common questions) are compiled in the <a href="faq.htm" target="main">FAQ</a>. If you encounter issues, please check the FAQ first. Additionally, if you think something should be added to the FAQ or manual, please share your suggestions on the forum.

<h4>System Requirements</h4>
<p class="text">
　It should work if you have a reasonably recent version of Java VM (Java Virtual Machine). If Java is unfamiliar or does not work, visit the official Java site (<a href="http://www.java.com/ja/" target="_blank">http://www.java.com/ja/</a>) to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).<br>
<ul class="text">
<li>Windows 98 or later (including Oracle JRE or OpenJDK variants like Amazon Corretto) is supported. Compatibility has been confirmed on Windows 98, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, and 11.
<li>Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04, 22.04 with OpenJDK) has been tested and works.
<li>Mac environments remain untested due to lack of access.
</ul>
