<h3 class="title1">Editor [General Formulas]</h3>
<p class="text">
In the "General Formulas" tab, you can configure a list of general formulas that can be substituted and used within various formulas and conditions. Up to 999 can be configured.<br>
Each general formula can be written in the form of formula[ ] (formula[0] to formula[999]) within various formulas and conditions, and will be replaced when the game data is loaded in the main program. It can be used in the same way as reference values.
